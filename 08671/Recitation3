Recitation 3

- Outline:
  
   - Conditionals
   - Arrays and loops (Enhanced for loops)
   - Methods
   - Classes(overloading vs overriding) (String builder,println vs toString)
   - Package
   
   - Static members (Think about static or not depends on if the method is related to specific instances)
     - Can't invoke instance method from static method (Create a new instance and access the instance method)
     - Can't access static variable from instance method (The same way)

   - Objects
     - When there is no equal method in instance, it will date back to its superclass(Most of time object)
       The default equal method define the equality as the same instance.
